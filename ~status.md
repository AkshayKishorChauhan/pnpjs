// TODO:: have a sample showing how to have a large timeline configuration wrapped in a single behavior including auth, central logging, etc and a way to share that across projects
// TODO:: do we want to move to .env files, seems to be a sorta "norm" folks are using?
// TODO:: kebab-case all file names
// TODO:: how do we feel about spfi and graphfi? Once we release, hard to change.
// TODO:: review of all remaining todos
// TODO:: remove status files
// TODO:: final review of todos
// TODO:: IA for docs, what is missing, what can go, what needs updated, what needs fully re-written?
// TODO:: Let's talk through what it means for people to add behaviors and come up with some guidelines for what we will include in the library. package size is a big win, let's not give it away.
